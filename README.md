The goal of this workshop is to provide postgraduate students and researchers training on how to incorporate reproducible methods of data processing and management into their own practice.

This workshop is designed for postgraduate students and academic colleagues who are interested in integrating principles of transparency and reproducibility into their own quantitative data-based research projects.

Learners will be guided through a reproducible data analysis exercise (tailored to the particular needs of your students) that focuses on transparency and the reproducibility of computational results.

Learning objectives:

* Understand core principles of computational reproducibility

* Understand the purposes and benefits of computational reproducibility

* Work with data by writing and executing code Establish a well-defined directory structure (in OSF)

* Identifying and managing a working directory (in RStudio) Use relative directory paths to identify file locations (in RStudio)

* Learn how to create an R Markdown file

* Understand practical implementation of these principles to create a fully reproducible analysis using R Markdown in RStudio
